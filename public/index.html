        <h2>üìú My Creed</h2>
        <p>
          Live your life like it's your last.
          Never foreshadow the past.
        Always have faith in the path you take.
        No matter the bumps or scraps. 
        The vision you saw will be the reality you make.
        Never dwindle, always continue the race.
        No matter the challenges or feats you face.
        Be true to yourself and those around you
        From which your reality is derived  
        When faced with a emotional challenge 
        Never act with haste sleep on it 
        
        </p>

        <p>
          Never doubt your ability to achieve and succeed.
          Never doubt your ability to lead .
          Never let anyone sway your core values.
          Trust yourself when all doubt you .
          But make allowance for their doubting too.
          Value yourself before you value anyone else.
          Always go within. If you ever feel like you are lost 
          Return to zero point. Never be afraid to begin a new
          For which a new you will bloom. The Unknown is not really scary 
          It is just an unlit path.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyday I will strive to be great.
Everyday I will strive to be better than yesterday .
Everyday I will strive to make the world a better place.
Everyday I will strive to be a man of my word .
Everyday I will strive to be a better friend.
Everyday I will strive to keep promises I make to myself.
Everyday I will strive to learn something new.
Everyday I will strive to be happy and smile.
Everyday I will strive to pick someone up while they are down
